ðŸŽ¯ This weather application provides real-time weather information for any location entered by the user. The app fetches weather data from a weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Key features include displaying the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity . 
ðŸŽ¯ Tools Used
â–ª HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
Purpose: Structure and content of the web pages.
Usage: Defines the layout of the web application, including input fields, buttons, and display areas for weather information.
â–ª CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Algorithm Used to Build the Application
Input Handling:
User enters a city name in the input field.
JavaScript captures the input when the "Get Weather" button is clicked.
API Request:

JavaScript constructs the API URL using the entered city name and API key.
JavaScript sends a fetch request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
Data Processing:

The API returns a JSON response containing weather data.
JavaScript extracts relevant information (e.g., temperature, humidity, weather description) from the response.
Display Update:

JavaScript dynamically updates the HTML to display the extracted weather information.
If an error occurs (e.g., city not found), JavaScript displays an error message.
This weather application demonstrates a practical use of web development technologies and APIs, creating a dynamic and user-friendly interface
